<!--this website is about Damian Lillards prime in the 2019-2020 season.
I made this page because he is probably one of my favourite players, and it is about him.
on this website i have made a strong argument on why you should support him and why he is one of the best PG of all time -->

    <h1 style="color: white;">Disrespect: Damian Lillards Prime</h1> 
    <p>As I was stumbling throughout my day, I heard a conversation between each of my friends; it was about the NBA and their various prolific point guards as of the current 2025 season. I thought to myself, “Huh, why don't I join in?” As we were conjoining together in deep conversation, there was a mention... a mention about a man... Devin Booker! As we were debating the great skillset of Mr. Booker, I suddenly had the urge to mention an all-time great... Damian Lillard. And you wanna know what they said? You don&apos;t wanna know the vile comments that came out of their mouths. They said that an all-time Devin Booker is greater than an all-time fricken goat Damian Lillard! Now, no offense to Devin Booker, he still has lots of time to be better, and he is one of the best point guards in the league ever, but offensively he isn&apos;t as good as the <strong>MONSTER</strong> that was Prime Damian Lillard.</br> 
        Now lemme just say, Damian Lillard always had his off days, but thats true for everybody, <i>no?</i> He wasn&apos;t just an offensive shooter; he had he fancy footwork, king like leadership, detrimental loyalty, and the him factor that many players don&apos;t have . Unlike some players (ahem KD) who are ring chasers, Dame stayed true and loyal to Portland, carrying them year after year, despite the lack of other superstars. That alone puts him on another level of greatness, and signifies him as a TOP 5 PG.  </mark></p>

    <p>And If you think I'm exaggerating,  lemme just break it down real quick. Damian Lillard's Bubble 2019-2020 performance and surrounding his whole career was nothing except short of legendary. This man was dropping numbers that could make a whole team start to cry and pop up double defense. Let&apos;s talk about his crazy stats: </p>

    <p>Now i just want to compare stats&colon; comparing the stats to the legendary prime James Harden he was averaging 36.1 points, 7.5 assists, and 6.6 rebounds&comma; while dame was averaging 30.0 points, 8.0 assists and 4.3 rebunds. Now Harden was otherworldly, but here&apos;s the thing: Lillard didn&apos;t rely on as many free throws to rack up his points. He was dropping logo threes, clutching up in playoff moments, and hard carrying teams. Sure, James Harden went crazy, but Dame was dropping near the same amount   
    And let's not forget the efficiency. Dame wasn&apos;t just shooting shots; he was making them at crazy percentages, which proves that he wasn&apos;t just a volume shooter, he was an unstoppable force on the offensive end. I know when you look at the numbers you may think Dame is still not much, but both of these stats are super crazy so you should put more respect on his name because of how similar each stat line is. </p>
